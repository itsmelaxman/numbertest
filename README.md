# Number Test App

The Number Test App is a simple Flutter application designed to test various properties of an integer number. It checks whether the number is positive, negative, even, odd, prime, or a palindrome

## Getting Started

To use the Number Test App, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your development environment. Clone the repository and run the app using an emulator or a physical device.

## Usage

### Input
The default number to be tested is set to 12. You can change the `number` variable in the `_MyHomePageState` class to test a different number.

```dart
var number = 7; // Change this variable to test a different number
```
### Running the Tests
When you run the app, it automatically tests the input number for the following properties:

- **Positive or Negative:** Determines if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Even or Odd:** Checks if the number is even or odd.
- **Prime or Not:** Determines if the number is a prime number or not.
- **Palindrome or Not:** Checks if the number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward) or not.

### Results
The app displays the results of these tests in a list format.

### Conclusion
The Number Test App provides a simple and interactive way to understand the properties of an integer number. It can be used as a learning tool or a quick reference for number properties. Feel free to modify and enhance the app for more complex number tests or additional features.
